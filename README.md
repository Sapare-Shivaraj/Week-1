Project Problem Statement
The world is facing increasing environmental degradation due to unsustainable
consumption of resources, pollution, and waste generation. Rapid urbanization,
industrialization, and population growth have led to excessive use of energy,
water, and raw materials, threatening the balance of ecosystems. There is an
urgent need for sustainable solutions that promote responsible resource use,
renewable energy adoption, and eco-friendly technologies to ensure
environmental, social, and economic well-being for future generations.
 Project Problem Statement
To address this issue, there is a need for an intelligent, automated system that can
accurately classify waste using advanced technologies like Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). Such a system can promote sustainable waste management,
support recycling initiatives, and reduce the environmental impact caused by
improper disposal practices.

DataSet
â€¢ Dataset Name: Garbage Dataset
 A Comprehensive Image Dataset for Garbage Classification and Recycling
About Dataset
This dataset contains images of garbage items categorized into 10 classes, designed for machine
learning and computer vision projects focusing on recycling and waste management. It is ideal for
building classification or object detection models or developing AI-powered solutions for
sustainable waste disposal.
